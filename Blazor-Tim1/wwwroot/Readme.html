<pre>Intro to AppSettings in .NET Core - Appsettings.json, secrets.json, and more - Tim Corey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2_qksdQKCE

@3:30 Create New Project ->Blazor App -> ... Blazor Server...

Set index. as default startup page. Test in IIS. 

appsettings.json is 1 of 5 places to store settings. It is the default location.
This is about 3 of the standard location, all are on by default.
appsettings is the last in the sequence of appsettings heirachy.
  Command line
  Environment vaiables
  Secrets  
  Environment specific settings
  appSettings
  
Add Configuration to Razor Page as such 
@inject IConfiguration _config 
  
@16:30 shows how to add configuration to a service (that is injected) by adding it 
to the constructor
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    public WeatherForcastService(IConfiguration config)
	{
	    _config = config;
	}
	private readonly IConfiguration _config;
	
17:40 Add to Imports.razor so you don't need full qualification in code
@using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration	

@29:00 - Development Security
Where to safely put connection strings, etc. sensitive data that needs to be protected.
  If it is in source control, it can also overwrite someone elses development

@31:00 Production Security
  Azure App Settings (very secured) .. or KeyVault...
  
Sew ... appsettings.development.json - only used when in development.
  @33:40 Properties -> launchSettings.json defines the environment for IIS Express and Kestrel
    "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development" 
  appsettings.development.json will be override appsettings.json.	
    (Should not even be a value in the field in appsettings.json)
  @37:00 will be Production if missing "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
    Only then does appsettings.development.json override appsettings.production.json
  File in server, not in source control, could ocverride values in appsettings.json
  
  appsettings.development.json should probably be in source control, but not appsettings.json
  so @40:40 rt click project and select Manage User Secrets, it created new json file 
  secrets.json. Access it by Rt Click ->Manage User Secrets. It's not stored in the project and 
  cannot even be checked in. It's ... elsewhere...
  Files specific to your machine, local environment. Different file for different apps.
  Sew secrets.json overrides both appsettings.json and appsettings.development.json.
  It's not encrypted, but is only available to your Profile...
  
  @45:00 - Production settings should not be on your machine. 
  appsettings.json - Would be for application, things that don't need to be overriden.
  appsettings.development.json - Would be for your local machine

@3:00 - Blazor Server - Does not run C# at the client.
        Keeps a connection open from client to server. 
		Signal R - probably websocket.
		
@7:30 Default mapping in App.razor (if a Route is declared)

@8:50 Under Pages/_Host.chstml is where CSS and js will be added.
      No, it's now in Pages/_Layout.chstml which is called by Pages/_Host.chstml. 
	    Very HTML like...
		Includes "_framework/blazor.server.js" - Communicates to server.

@11:00 Razor applications use .cshtml extension		
	   Blazor applications use .razor extension		
		
@12:00	@Page - sets path to page. Might not be page name?

@13:00 Blazor pages have the code on the Blazor page itself. 
       Keep the C# code short, less than 100 lines. USe Library.
   
@14:30 - Counter Page. @15:30 - onclick Button.   
   @17:15 Run in Kestrel... by selecting the project name.

@21:00 there is a Stay Alive message on the network. Web Sockets use Binary Transfer.
  ... Did not refresh page, just moved value to be updated and where to update it.
  
@24:00 Fetch Data page needed to transfer some more data.  
  @26:00 - Shows about injection of WeatherForecastService 
 
@32:30 - Hook to SQL, select, insert.
   @33:00 Add a Class Library. (Using .Net Standard - more portable)
     Add ->New Project ->Class Library C# .Net or .Net Standard (video just says .Net Standard)
	 - DataAccessLibrary - [Change from .Net 6.0 to .Nst Standard 2.0]
	 Remove class1.cs. Add class SqlDataAccess
	 
@34:20 Use Dapper - ->Tools ->NuGet Package Manager ->Manage NuGet Packages for solution.
	->DataAccessLibrary ->Install 2.0.123
    - Create constructor in DataAccessLibrary	
	
@40:00 Extract Interface - on Class Name Rt Clcik ->Quick Actions and Refactoring ->Extract Interface 
    ->To New File ISqlDataAccess.cs	(Leave it where it is instead of moving it to an interfaces folder)
	
@40:50 Add New Class PeopleData.cs (to Library)
  Add new class in Models folder - PersonModel.cds
[[add key="SqlConnectionString1" value="Data Source=HLSQLStage01\Warehouse; initial catalog=SalesForce; Integrated Security=True" />	

@47:00 Add to program.cs (lots of problems with internal access needing to be public.)
  builder.Services.AddTransient[[ISqlDataAccess, SqlDataAccess>();
  builder.Services.AddTransient[[IPeopleData, PeopleData>(); 

@49:00 Create page for inserting People under new folder "MyPages" (to show about routing - weird)
   Add ->New Item ->Razor Component "People.razor"->
   To top of page, add @page "/Data/People"... 
     Best practices would be to name it "/MyPages/People", but the point is that you don't have to.

@54:00 	Making the Razor Page. 

@57:40 - Add it to the NavMenu	 

@59.40 - Add data to Person. Add Models folder. 
    Add Class DisplayPersonModel.. so UI specific code can be added here. 
	
@1:10:35 Add new person to people List... shows nothing Db specific, so needs no Db call	

@1:13:20 - Test
@1:15:00 - Replaces Angular, React, Vue Frameworks
@1:17:20 - You can use javascript if you want to...
</pre>

<pre>PROBLEM: In SqlDataAccess.cs it uses: --- This fixed itself
string connectionString = _config.GetConnectionString(ConnectionStringName);
but GetConnectionString shows the error: 
  iconfiguration does not contain a definition for getconnectionstring
  
Sew... 
1. https://pmichaels.net/2020/09/26/iconfiguration-does-not-contain-a-definition-for-getvalue/
  Typically appears when you’re using IConfiguration outside of an Asp.Net Core app. In fact, GetValue is an extension method, so the solution is to simply add the following package:
Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder
  So, does that exist in the project? It should.
  In index.razor, it works as Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration... looks good so far.
  It sort of looks like the command above is for Powershell, but it could be done with NuGet.
  So, let's see if we can find it with NuGet. It's there. Add it to DataAccesLibrary project
  Doesn't look good. Close VS and open it again. No help. Error shows as:
  Cannot implicitly convert type 'DataAccessLibrary.IConfiguration to
  'Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.IConfiguration. An explixit conversion exists (are you missing a caste?)
Show me a >net core class using iConfiguration to get a connection string  
... Dang... It fixed itself...

<pre>Lesson 1. Introduction
Blazor Server is an ASP.Net Core Web Application that uses SignalR to enable 
client side interactions to create a Single Page Application (SPA) powered by C#.

SignalR is a connection stream.
</pre>
<pre>Lesson 2. Where does Blazor Server Fit.
Best for Client Side data interaction. All code on the server.
There can be a limitation to SignalR > 10,000.
Easier to debug. No Offline support.
Is Blazer Server scalable - It ahs open SignalR connection. Testing shows very scalable.
  On Azure - medium sized instance > 10,000 users ... or get an Azure SignalR Service.
Works as a global standard, not propriatory standards.
Does more than javascript. Tends to replace javascript frameworks.
  
Blazor Client - Client Side libraries in C# (DLL) downloaded to the Client
  Needs some server code like for Database access.
  Offline support.
  Uses Web Assembly, a global staandard.

Code in Program.cs file is weird. It's not in a class... It's unique.

Blank Templates. ... Just says "Hello World"...

Kestrel Configuration- local server.
  You can change the port number in launchSettings.json if you want.

Hot Reload - Fails occasionally... when there are too many changes. Matters not.
  Can be automatic... say when file saved...
  Can be web code or even C#... State remains, unlike a reload.
  Can do more than I ever thought.
  
Header Components
  Different pages have different titles... not just in header.
  @4:10 Even Changing values in...
    [[PageTitle>Title[[/PageTitle>
  @7:00 [[HeadContent .../> Add metadata or anyhting else you want in the header besides the title.
     [[HeadContent>
	   [[meta name="description" content="What this page is about".>
	 [[/HeadContent>
  @12:50 - You can change/add pretty much anything in the header including .js and .css.	 

Query String Parameters Can be passed in as part of the URL and update the UI.
  [[Parameter>

Error Boundaries - Exceptions used to effect the entire application, but starting 
  in .Net 6. ... Seems to be an exception handler for components on a Page and only 
  effects the one component.
  Weird Shit... Look at the first couple minutes of this. It shows the Counter 
  Page is a component??????? that can be put on other pages.

Accessibility Updates - A lot is built in full template, but not in blank template. 
   Standard tabbing and accessibility methods and standards.
  Navigate, Nav elements very tabbable so starts at expected element.
  role is for that
  [[main> gives context... 
  
File Upload - Not in 3.1, can still be useful
  File Upload built into Blazer.  
  [logging is injected in this code.]
  Creates random name, because likely same file name could be uploaded multiple.

<pre>* Section Introduction
  Basic Template
  How Routing Works
  Development Hosting
  Error Handling - Exceptions, bad URLs
  Static Files
  Conclusion  
  
Homework -  Blazor site with the following
  A custom html error page with an image for when you navigate to a missing page.
  2 Custom Routes in addition to their current routes
    to the counter page (.../Counter/20) 
	to the weather page (.../Weather)    
</pre>
<pre>*** Basic Template ***

IIS will give different ports for each project.
Kestrel will use ports 5000, 5001. Could be collision.
</pre>
<pre>*** Routing ***
Console App -Starts at Main

app.razor is where the routing comes from. (follows from _layout.shtml)
  Allows choice if route found or route not found.
@10:40 in App.razor shows default route (Layout) and error message for fails.
@15:00 ... You can have more than one route in a page... Weird...

@16:20 ... So ...Add new page director to existing one...
  @page "/counter"
  @page "/counter/{StarterValue:int}"
  
  Routing in App.razor changes if there is Authentication.
</pre>
<pre>*** Development Hosting ***
  .\Properties\launchSettings.json controls how the web server works.
</pre>
<pre>*** Section 2 Lesson 5 Error Handling ***
  Expected and unexpected Errors
  It's different in Blazor because there is a connection. Unhandled Exceptions can break that.
  Two types of errors.
  a. Missing Page - App.Razor rezponds because it handles routing... and that route isn't found.
     Pretty brief, so add more stuff around it. Add a new page. Could be anything including a 
	 component ... [[BlazorApp.Pages.Error>
  b. Unhandled Exception - Gives message on page and reloads. The error messages also shows in 
     the Developer Tools, if the environment developer is Development in launchSettings.json (DeveloperMode). Much less data given in "Production".
	 Better to catch what exceptions you can, otherwise what message to give use.
	   From Hosts.chtml calling _Layout.cshtml -> [[div id="blazor-error-ui">	 
</pre>

<pre>*** Section 2 Lesson 6 Static Files ***

    <h3 onclick="toggleDiv('Net033n');">Section 3 - Included Systems</h3>
    <div id="idDivNet033n" style="display:none;">
<pre>* Introduction
  Homework: Create a Blazor site with the following
    a. A class that is shared only inside the same instance that stores the 
	  counter value and logs counter value changes. (Between page changes.)
	  
	b. A weather forecast with the number of days specified in the appsettings.json file
	
	c. A better looking table for the weather forecast.	
</pre>
<pre>* Dependency Injection - Program.cs  
  Runs in the background, waiting for requests.
  You can put in and remove parts of the ASP.Net system. 
  
  Make IDataAccess.cs Interface. (Might be more than one DataAccess class)
  
  There are 3 ways to add services  
    1. builder.Services.AddSingleton - One Instance per App and lasts the life of the application.
	   Not necessarily good if you are reading data. Scope is wrong for that. 
    2. builder.Services.AddScoped
    3. builder.Services.AddTransient


He defaults to using Transient... to avoid sharing data and to make sure a session is closed.
Singleton can add efficiency, but not often.

Dependency Injection is running, but then it has to be @inject at the page...
It can also be injected into a class as a constructor parameter. 	
	
This dependency injection can be replaced by a more sophisticated system if you need
to for some reason.

You can get a lot of dependencys lixsted, but that is OK. They are in one place and anyone 
can find them.

Remember, models do not need interfaces as they can't really be replaced.
</pre>
<pre>* Logging
Out of the box, logging is installed and enabled by default.
It starts out logging to the background command prompt the site is running in.
It is also in the output pane. 

Log Levels:
  Trace - Shows too much
  Debug 
  Information - default
  Warning
  Error
  Critical

Inject ILogger into the page - injected stuff is available onInitialization() 
@37:30 You can add logging to a class the same way. See WeatherForecastService.cd

Change logging in appSettings.json
@21:00 Keep in mind though is that the log setting in the launchSettings.json overrides 
  what is in appSettings.json.
@25:00 - How to catch just certain messages.... Wow.  
  
@28:30 - Changing Microsoft logging in program.cs   
This is going to be different for .Net 6.
.ConfigurtionLogging(logger => 
{
logger.ClearProviders(); // Clears out the defaults
logger.AddConsole();     // Turn back on Capture Window
logger.AddDebug();        // turn back on debug in Output window.
  // Really, with both those turned on again, you won't see any difference.
// You could also set the loggin level here instead of in the appSettings.json, 
// but don't do that because it cannot be changed at runtime. 
logger.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Information);  
});

You generally only want to log Warning and above in Production, otherwise it makes a mess.

Generally the code for the Microsoft debugger works interchangably with other 
loggers you want to use. 

You don't use asynchronous logging because it can slows things down.
Using SQL logging, it tends to get enqueud to speed up SQL writing.
</pre>

<pre>* Configuration - See below a bit...
</pre>
<pre>* Bootstrap
Authentication Pages use Bootstrap by default.
In _Layout.shtml is a reference to Bootstrap.css, but no mention of Bootstrap.js

Bootstrap is up to ver. 5 at this point. This has Bootstrap v5.1.0

Make any css changes you want to make in site.css.

It doesn't look likee there is any javascript... because Blazor is supposed to be about
using C# for data display and manipulation. You may still need javascript
to manipulate the DOM. ... Of course there is blazor..js

    <h3 onclick="toggleDiv('Net04');">Section 4. Pages</h3>
    <div id="idDivNet04" style="display:none;">
<pre>* Intro - Homework
Copyright notice in the default layout footer
A secondary Layout for new pages that identifies them as eexperimental.
Working voting buttons on the layout page.
</pre>

<pre>* Default Layout
_Host.cshtml just calls _Layout.cshtml - Interesting, that may make it harder to change in the page.

_Layout.cshtml calls RazorPage.cs @RenderBody() 
  which returns IHtmlContent ? RazorPageBase.BodyContent;

Then to Shared\MainLayout.razor ... has @Body 

In Shared\MainLayout.razor (like other places) is a component declaration [[NavMenu />
Shared\NavMenu.razor does not have an @Page command at the top.
.......Blazor is composable....
Notice it inherits @inherits LayoutComponentBase

Lights up "link"
Match="NavLinkMatch.All" 
  would match localhost:5556 localhost:5556, not localhost:5556/Temp
Match="NavLinkMatch.PrefixMatch" (Default)
  would match localhost:5556/Counter to localhost:5556/Counter and localhost:5556/Counter/2

href just starts in the root by default...  href="counter", not  href="/counter"

oi = Open Iconic - free icons ( as opposed to Fonts Awesome)
</pre>

<pre>* Creating Pages - Add a Razor component, which is a Blazor page.
</pre>

<pre>* Page Code Support 
Code can be on page and is accessible to HTML page.
To call code that is moved off the page, make a new class and inherit from it.
  See Counter.razor and CounterBase.cs
  
@7:00 how to bring in a logger... Create a property. 

@11:00, there is a new way of doing this though. See FetchData page. He prefers this way.
    Make a class the same name as the page - FetchData.cs
    ...
 
Code on a HTML page or moving it off is about choosing a balance.
"Put only code on your page that relates to displaying on the page".
</pre>

<pre>* Razor Syntax - Works across all .Net Core offerings. 
    A couple tweeks are Bllazor specific.
The '@' sysmbol defines Razor syntax.	

Escape it with @@	

.. so how about @iInt + 5 - changes it to a literal. so use @(iInt + 5)

For Multiple Lines, but this is sort of like class code... so
@{
    var iInt2 = iInt + 5
}
@iInt2

So how about @("[[h1> This is a header[[/h1>") ? It renders it as a literal string instead of html.
@Html.Raw("Put your html here") But Blazor is a bit different.
It would be @((MarkupString)"Put your html here") --- Pay attention to this.

@onClick = "method" is Blazor Syntax. There are lots of other "on" events available. Sure
seems like javascript to me or a Windows event.

See FetchData.razor for @if ... {... ... ...} else {... ... ...}
While, do while, for loops work too.
</pre>

<pre>* Layout Pages - Copy MainLayout.razor code to

Every Blazor page or component is really just a class so you can have inheritence.

A layout page has to have an @body tag on it somewhere. It is a Razor Component.
Add SimpleLayout.razor. 
</pre>

    <h3 onclick="toggleDiv('Net0bwc');">Section 5. Components</h3>
    <div id="idDivNet0bwc" style="display:none;">
<pre>Introduction - Components are the heart of Blazor.
Create a Blazor Site with the following:
A list of components that shows a user's first and last name.
A "fix" button next to each name that displays a list of name alternatives. Sue Storm ->Storm, Sue
Clicking on an alternative should update the displayed name of the user.
</pre>
<pre>* Using Pages - As components.
Add page Components.razor - add to Nav Menu

Add component (a counter page) to page to make composition.
... They are really components, but we treat them as pages...
... Like breaking down code into blocks... that can be called... why you add "Razor Components" 
    instead of Razor Pages. 
They are Web Components, but done differently... (no javascript file.)
</pre>
<pre>* Parameters - Sending data to a component.
Make page (Razor Component) ComponentParameters.razor
So how do we send a parameter to the Counter component? (See code)

In the component getting the parameter:
  Add Property with [Parameter]
  Use protected override void OnParameterSet() 

In the page calling the component, Put it in the opening tag...[[Counter StartingValue="5">[[/Counter>
Could be multiple parameters.

So you can make a page out of copies of a components, with different parameters.

Make new folder: Models for data to use... Add PeronModel.cs and AddressModel.cs
    Create fake test data.
Make Directory.razor to compose and display components for the PersonModel and Address Model.
... Uses RenderFragment...
</pre>
<pre>* Events
Like Parameters in reverse that sends data from component back to parent.
    // Pass back a string in this case. Probably should be an enum.
    [Parameter]
    public EventCallback[[string> onVoted { get; set; } 

Make Vote.razor - With button. 
Add to Counter
Add to FetchData 

You can use the component differently on different pages because of how you can react to it.

The event doesn't necessarily have to be handled.
Multiple events can be called as well.
